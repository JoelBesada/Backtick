**Backtick is a console for bookmarklets and scripts**, packaged as a Chrome extension. For a better explanation, try out the demo at [backtick.io/](http://backtick.io). The extension is free to use, but it will occasionally nag you to install the [$5 Backtick license](Backtick License).

#### Why are you open sourcing this?
Because that's just something I like to do to contribute back to the community. It also forces me to write cleaner code. (Well, in theory at least)

#### But wait, couldn't I just clone this repo and remove the nag dialog for myself?
Yes, you absolutely could. That's why I've made it [extra easy for you](https://github.com/JoelBesada/Backtick/blob/master/extension/license.coffee#L2), just flip that boolean to true and you're good to go. However, a nicer option would be to actually buy [the license](Backtick License) to support the continued development of Backtick.
